# Open SDG - Simple starter

This is a starter repository to help in implementing the [Open SDG](https://github.com/open-sdg/open-sdg) platform. [See here for documentation](https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io).

* Python 3 with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)
* Ruby 2 with [bundler](https://bundler.io/)
